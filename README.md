Random Playground is a repository for exercises of analysis and simulation of known problems on 
Randomness, Complexity, Dynamical Systems and Chaos Theory. Code is mainly written in Python. Algorithms may be original or "translated" from other languages.
In the latter case, original sources are informed. All references for further exploration are shared. 
Collaborations and discussions on the explored (and additional) topics are welcomed.
