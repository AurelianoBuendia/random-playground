# Random Playground

Random Playground is a repository for exercises of analysis and simulation of known problems on 
Randomness, Complexity, Dynamical Systems and Chaos Theory. Code is mainly written in Python. Algorithms may be original or "translated" from other sources/languages, when they were not already available in Python (at least for the best of my knowledge at the time). \
In the latter case, references to original sources are informed. \
Collaborations and discussions on the explored (and additional) topics are welcomed.
